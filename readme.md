## Introduction:

Traffic signs are the most important part of our road safety because they tell you something important before you drive down that curve. They provide instructions to be followed at major junctions or crossroads, guide drivers to ensure the safe and proper functioning of road traffic. Being unaware of traffic signs is like driving blind!
Approximately, 1.35 million people die each year as a result of road traffic crashes. Most of the governments in the world have made it mandatory to follow traffic rules and signs.


## Problem Statment:
Helping drivers and autonomous vehicles to follow the traffic rules by sending them notifications, letting the driver, for example, know that there is a stop sign ahead or that the speed limit is 50 km/h on a certain street.


## Executive Summary:
1\ Objective: Traffic signs classification is the process of identifying which class a traffic sign belongs to.



## Datasets Description:
German Traffic Sign from kaggle
Images are 32 (width) x 32 (height) x 3 (RGB color channels)
More than 50,000 images in total
There are 43 classes (e.g. Speed Limit 20km/h, No entry, Bumpy road, etc.)


## Conclusions:
In this Python project with source code, I have successfully classified the traffic signs classifier with 99% accuracy and also visualized how our accuracy and loss changes with time, which is pretty good from a simple CNN model.
